This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Shadcn UI Usage
Use the manual way, the CLI way causes changes to the current theme that we do not want, so we need to just do this manually.

[shadcn/ui docs](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/)

## Supabase Development
The app uses supabase for DB, and possibly authentication. For local development, you will need to run `supabase start` with Docker Desktop running. 
You might also need to run `supabase db pull` to retrieve the latest database schema. Run `supabase db reset` to reset yopur local DB.
